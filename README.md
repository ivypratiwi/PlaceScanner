# PlaceScanner

The main purpose of this API mashup is searching and providing knowledge from the pictures of popular landmarks across the nations. The idea of this mashup is to give information quickly from an image which was uploaded by the user. In return, the user will get information on the places from an image which have been uploaded to the web app. The information will be in the form of a Youtube video, the country, city, state and address of which the landmark is located, with a map to show the exact location of the landmark.
